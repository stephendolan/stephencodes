- Summary

  - What causes me the most struggle is over-tooling
  - Sometimes keeping it simple is best
  - Use your inbox as an inbox

- The Details

  - "Action" and "Waiting" labels
    - Suggestion to colorize appropriately
    - Set to "Show" always
  - New items are either:
    - Archived for reference (with an appropriate label)
    - "Action" if you need to clarify the next action for it
    - "Waiting" if you sent the mail and need to wait for a response
  - Why not directly integrated with task manager like Omni or Todoist (link extensions)
    - Don't overtool your setup. You'll always use Gmail, and you can funnel items from these labels however you like

- Other helpful tips
  - Using the Gmail app? Set a swipe action to "Move"
    - Include a gif of this in action
  - Learn Gmail keyboard shortcuts
    - `gl action<enter>` to process
    - `l action<enter>` to add
  - Process daily, don't let them stack up
